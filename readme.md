# Psygotchi
Welcome to the Psygotchi Project.

***Why 'Psygotchi'* ?**
Psygotchi was born from a late night chat among friends. Like most of the ideas that happen in my life, this was a 'why not?' moment. I've used the Pwnagotchi and its a great piece of software but i wanted to create a fun digital friend using the Raspberry pi Zero and the waveshare 2.13" e-paper screen.

***And the name 'Psygotchi'* ?**
Its a mashup of Tamagotchi and the friend that inspired this Psymons... so Psy-gotchi

***About this project***
  This project uses a Pi zero and e-paper screen to display a digital pet. you can play with it using its built in webserver, it has a range of activities that you can do. You can teach it and level it up.

  You feed it by taking it around with you, it uses the tastiest of digital signals as food. Wifi SSID's!
  Wifi SSID's are the names of Wifi networks. You pass hundresds of them everyday. Psygotchi takes them, and cooks them up and gives them a score between 1 and 10. it saves the low score ones ready to donate to other hungry psygotchi's as your Psygotchi get hungry it will eat the cooked ones. (don't let your meals get low enough it has to eat the low score ones)
